# 4_ Machine learning

## 1_ What is ML ?

### Definition

Machine Learning is part of the Artificial Intelligences study. It concerns the conception, devloppement and implementation of sophisticated methods, allowing a machine to achieve really hard tasks, nearly impossible to solve with classic algorithms.

## 4_ Supervised learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from __labeled training data__. 

The training data consist of a __set of training examples__. 

In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). 

A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. 

__An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances__.

## 5_ Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure __from "unlabeled" data__ (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations). 

Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output by the relevant algorithm—which is one way of distinguishing unsupervised learning from supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

## 22_ Perceptron

The perceptron has been the first model described in the 50ies.

This is a __binary classifier__, ie it can't separate more than 2 groups, and thoses groups have to be __linearly separable__.

The perceptron __works like a biological neuron__. It calculate an activation value, and if this value if positive, it returns 1, 0 otherwise.
